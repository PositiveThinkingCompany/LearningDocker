# Learning Plan

- Setup Rest Api ( IIS hosted)
- Setup Rest Api ( self hosted)
- Create container for Rest API

# Setup Rest Api

Create new project in VS2019: .NET Full Framework Web Application for Web API, I choose with docker and https support.
Enabling Docker Support here triggers the download of the required layers.
Removed MVC unnecessary parts
Added basic .gitignore file ( search for Visual Studio gitignore)

Debugging -> start container for my aplication ( tagged dev)

VS opens the ip adress of the container with used portnumber.
Append  api\values
